Write a C program to get the sum of two numbers:

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
	int *p,*q,a,b,sum;
	printf("Enter the value of A = ");
	scanf("%d",&a);
	printf("Enter the value of B = ");
	scanf("%d",&b);
	p=&a;
	q=&b;
	sum= *p+*q;
	printf("The sum of two numbers = %d",sum);
	return 0;
}

Test cases:

case 1:
Enter the value of A = 0
Enter the value of B = 4
The sum of two numbers = 4

Case 2:
Enter the value of A = 5
Enter the value of B = 0
The sum of two numbers = 5

Case 3:
Enter the value of A = -3
Enter the value of B = 3
The sum of two numbers = 0

Case 4:
Enter the value of A = 0
Enter the value of B = 0
The sum of two numbers = 0

Case 5:
Enter the value of A = 123
Enter the value of B = 123
The sum of two numbers = 246
